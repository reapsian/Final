		<h1>Welcome to the PSU Creative Writing Through COVID-19 Project!</h1>
		<h1>Why This Research Matters</h1>
		<p>Through this proposal, my objective is simple. I want to try and uncover how COVID-19 affects the writing of students in the creative writing program at Portland State University. The trajectory of our world irreversibly shifted as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect almost every part of our daily lives. Artists across the creative spectrum have felt the reverberations of such a calamity resonate through their minds, and subsequently through their art. For my project, Iâ€™ve decided to concentrate on the intersection of the creative writing community and college student life, to study how students here at PSU have been impacted by this tragedy in particular. Recent articles illustrate the debilitating effects the pandemic is having on mental health among adults and youth. The article cites a survey from June 2020 conducted by the CDC that polled adults on whether they had recently seriously considered suicide. The response showed a staggering 10% of subjects had, a drastic increase from the 4% found just two years prior. (Svrluga et al., 2021.) If the mental health of the adult population is in decline, the mental health of the young adults of the students here at PSU must have been affected by the pandemic as well. The heart of what I want to investigate revolves around a singular topic. How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected the creative writing of Portland State University students? 

	From May 2020 to December 2021, there have been a total of 151 cases of COVID-19 at PSU. Out of the entirety of the 23,979 students currently enrolled, this is still only a minor amount of infection among the faculty and students. (Portland State University, 2021.) However, the psychological impact of the lockdown cannot be understated. The stress of the pandemic has caused some to experience a great shift in the way they conduct their creative ventures, an unfortunate reaction to the millions dead across the globe. In a report conducted by WeTransfer, they surveyed 35,000 people across the globe and discovered that 45.3% believed they had experienced more creative ideas over the pandemic rather than prior. (Schneider, 2021.) As a student who has had their entire college experience tarnished by a global pandemic, I have not had quite the same time as my older peers who have had years of COVID-less college under their belts. If the way creative people work has been altered in the wake of the pandemic, how have those that could be considered creative individuals here at PSU been affected? Through the pursuit of my question, I seek to gain a deeper understanding of how COVID-19 affects the writing of the students involved in the creative writing program at Portland State University.
