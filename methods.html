		<h1>Methods</h1>
		<p>In my own investigation, I plan on dispensing a small, digital, multiple-choice answer poll to quickly and easily gather feedback and receive the impressions of the creative writing student community here at PSU and how they feel the pandemic has affected their work. Ideally, I would be able to dispense this poll to at least 50 students, in order to gather a wide range of responses. I will tailor this poll to the different grades, such as freshman or sophomore level because I am curious how the pandemic has influenced their writing over the course of their entire experience at Portland State University. I would also do this with juniors and seniors because I want to understand how their writing throughout college has changed as opposed to how it was before COVID-19. 
	
	Once all this information has been accumulated, I intend to compare the responses on a large scale spreadsheet in order to understand the public feeling of those here at PSU involved in the creative writing program. By asking questions revolving around their mental health, the tone of their writing, and their experiences with the pandemic, the poll will allow for the accumulation of relevant data among the multiple choices. Due to the online nature of this course and the COVID-impacted world around us, the survey method seems the most apt in order to quickly gather data with little risk to the participants. Using digital surveying programs such as Googleâ€™s own poll system, I can gather the data with maximum ease for the participant. After this, I can establish a graph as a way to quickly see and assess the answers provided by the poll system. Ideally, I would get into contact with creative writing teachers in order to broadcast this survey and encourage their students to participate.
