		<h1>What Others Have to Say On Similar Issues</h1>
		<p> The effects of COVID-19 on the mind and creativity itself are also being intensely investigated by others. Psychologists across the globe are taking what little advantage there is to the pandemic in order to study its prolonged effects on the human mind. Effectiveness of Expressive Writing in the Reduction of Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Randomized Controlled Trial (Markovic et al., 2020.)  directly researches the effects of expressive writing on subjects during the pandemic. In the pursuit of trying to find ways to reduce psychological stress on people during the pandemic, what they found was unfortunately the opposite. In writing about their time over the pandemic, they sunk deeper into their own stress rather than any kind of relief. I find the results of this study interesting and relevant to my research question, and am curious if there were any parallels to be spotted within the writing crafted by our own PSU students here within the creative writing program. 
	
	The second study I looked into was COVID-19: A Boon or a Bane for Creativity? (Mercier et al., 2021.) an investigation conducted in France into the effects of the lockdown on civilian creativity. Using the data gathered, they found some interesting information about the activities of the populace during lockdown. While creativity relating to the career of a participant did not experience a growth over the quarantine, creative activities outside of a working, professional sense experienced a surge. The study also found that those that were the “lowest” in creative motivation before quarantine found themselves using it as an opportunity to try new things, while those with “high” creativity before the lockdown were having a difficult time adapting to the new circumstances. While this experiment focused on the effects of lockdown on generally creative people in France, it does have limitations in its specificity and location. However, the information gathered within this experiment is pertinent to the question I am trying to answer, as writing is most definitely a form of creative work. 

	The third and final piece of scholarly research I located is Creativity as a Means to Well-Being in Times of COVID-19 Pandemic: Results of a Cross-Cultural Study. (Tang et al., 2021.) The researchers drew on subjects from across China, America, and Germany to try and find if creativity is a means to well-being and social connectedness when facing a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, and if its effects differ between varying countries. The data they collected shows a clear connection between indulging in creativity and an increase in the sense of well-being across all cultures. The concept of using creative work as a way to cope with the pandemic is one I have seen prior material about before, but what I want to know more about within this study is how they used creativity to cope.
