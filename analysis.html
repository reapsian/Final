		<h1>What I Will Do WIth the Data</h1>
		<p>The data I collect through the poll will eventually be tallied up and the cumulative answers to the questions given will be displayed. I plan to provide an in-depth reflection on the answers given and how they indicate the effects of the quarantine on the creative writing student population here. Through the questions I ask, I hope my probing provides an explanation of their responses and a deeper understanding of how they feel they and their writing have become impacted.
